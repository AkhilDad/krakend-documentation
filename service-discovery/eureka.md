Users of the Netflix's service [Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) have a couple of user contributed integrations available listed in our [krakend-contrib](https://github.com/devopsfaith/krakend-contrib) repository.

The integrations are not bundled with KrakenD-CE releases but they can be added to the project and make a custom build without difficulties.

- [schibsted/krakend-eureka](https://github.com/schibsted/krakend-eureka): The Eureka client [Schibsted](https://www.schibsted.com) has been running in production since 2017.
