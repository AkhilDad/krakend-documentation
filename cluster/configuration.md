Hardware can fail at any time, and a Gateway is a piece critical enough to have redundancy of the service. Having a cluster of machines operating the service assures high availability.

Running a cluster of machines is a straightforward process that only requires two conditions:

- Having a balancer in front of the machines (e.g., ELB, Haproxy)
- Run two or more KrakenD services

When all the desired nodes of KrakenD run, all metrics share a universal `cluster ID` between the nodes. This information can be used to filter the behavior of all servers sharing the same cluster.

Modifying the `krakend.json` file and deploying the changes produces a new `cluster ID`. When all your nodes update to the new configuration, they all have changed to a shared cluster again.

# Autogenerated cluster ID
When KrakenD starts, you can immediately observe in the logs the `cluster ID` information:

    INFO registering usage stats for cluster ID 'CGfjz3BrDgtk+noDcxw18WxxbxtNPb6Rv6C5zArhhG8='

The cluster ID generation is using the calculated `SHA` of the configuration file, meaning that no matter how many nodes of KrakenD you run, all machines belong to the same cluster while they share configuration.

One of the benefits of having a decentralized system is that you can have the same cluster when machines are in different networks or regions, or even when visibility between themselves is not working.
