# KrakenD Documentation
All the documentation uses Markdown syntax and the site is generated using [Hugo](gohugo.io). After your contribution this repository will be used to compile all the documentation.

If you want to use a server to browse this pages, although not necessary, you can copy the folder inside the `content` directory in any Hugo installation.

# Contribute!
Feel free to fork this repository and contribute to a better KrakenD documentation.

If you'd like to add a new language please open an issue before doing the work as we will need to add the support before it is visible.

Thanks for improving the docs!
