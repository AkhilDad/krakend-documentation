The `ocagent` exporter sends OpenCensus Stats and Traces to the OpenCensus Agent, instead of pushing data to backendsâ€™ exporters.

For instance, you can enable ocagent to upload data to the OpenCensus Agent and from there, the agent is simple scraped by a Prometheus.

You can integrate the OpenCensus Agent with Azure Monitor, Jaeger, or Prometheus to name a few examples.

Enabling it only requires you to add the `ocagent` exporter in the [opencensus module](/docs/logging-metrics-tracing/opencensus/).

The following configuration snippet sends the data:

    "github_com/devopsfaith/krakend-opencensus": {
      "exporters": {
       "ocagent": {
          "address": "collector",
          "service_name": "krakend",
          "reconnection": "2s",
           "insecure": false,
          "enable_compression": true,
          "headers": {
            "header1": "value1"
          }
        }
      }
    }

- `address` (*string*): The address of your Azure Monitor collector.
- `service_name` (*string*): An identifier of your service.
- `reconnection` (*time*): The reconnection time, you need to specifiy its units, examples: `1000ms`, `2s`, `1m`
- `insecure` (*bool*): Whether the connection can be stablished in plain or not.
- `enable_compression` (*bool*): Whether to send data compressed or not.
- `headers` (*key(value*): Sent headers with its values.

See also the [additional settings](/docs/logging-metrics-tracing/opencensus/) of the Opencensus module that can be declared.
